This is a repository for trying out GitHub stuff. It has a Python .gitignore, because that is why I am usually experimenting with. This repository may not contain working code. It's purpose is primarily to view code on the web after pushing to GitHub, and may include things that I can't preview locally. It also includes a GitHub Pages so that I can view themes without changing a real GH Pages repo.

**It is strongly recommended that you not copy any code or documentation from this repo, unless participating in troubleshooting or testing with me.**

No license is provided as code and text subject to a variety of licenses may be copied from other repos for testing purposes only. All original licenses apply.
